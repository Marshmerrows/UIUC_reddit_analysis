	India’s modernization is the process of India changing to provide for the modern needs of its people. In India the economic, scientific, and technological explosion are among the premier reasons for immense linguistic diversity, as stated by Mahendra Verma in English in India “It has often been accepted that apart from Sanskrit and the local languages/dialects, English has had the most impact on the modernization of Hindi and other Indian languages. English has contributed to the development of the Hindi lexicon to cope with the rapid expansion of science and technology” (5). Globally the main language in which business exchanges are organized in is English individuals seeking to pursue a career in this field it would follow that they would have to learn English. In a similar example of modernization if a young student is interested in pursuing a career in a foreign country they would have to learn the language of that country. In a nation such as India where students plan to one day achieve a career in the United States it would be helpful for students to study in English medium schools the creation of them increases the exposure to the English language. The exposure to English should not be condemned because it is beneficial to the people of India. However, while English increases opportunities for individuals one can argue that it causes damage to native Indian languages.
   India a land that is referred to as a Tower of babel an area defined by its immense linguistic diversity could never be destroyed by more language diversity such as English implanting itself within India. India’s have a history of maintaining their language even after migration from one area to another they maintain their mother tongue across several generations it cannot be that a language used for careers could eliminate a deeply embedded culture alone. To view English as a destructive force, individual must willingly give up their language and culture however as long as that individual follows the practices of the culture and uses the language within their home they will exist in a state of diglossia. English itself does not present a direct danger to the Indian languages to learn English in India is to open a world of opportunities but if individuals choose to leave behind their language and culture for another than it is a matter of the individual killing the Indian languages not English. 
        	India in the future will continue to be a linguistic and cultural melting pot not as powerful as it is now but still a land of individuals that are proud of their language and culture. In this 50 years in the future prediction India continues to use English as a co-official language but has begun to streamline its economy to reflect the fact that in globalized India large cities must be English speaking while Indian languages will reside as a secondary language or a primary language in smaller cities and towns. This India is one that modern carry their language as a cultural artifact and not so much as means of communication.
