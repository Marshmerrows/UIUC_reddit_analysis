	Dormitory lifestyle as a first year student has been a University staple for many years, creating a smooth and effective transition from high school for most students. Over a multitude of decades’ dorms have developed several methods to ensure the best living conditions for students. The conditions most comforting for students are constantly changing requiring dormitories to modify their methods. However, these dorms still manage to consistently uphold the staples of university housing policy. The way that all these new dormitories and Living Learning Communities (LLCs) manage to maintain these staples is through the use of multiple genres. Genres as the definition used within the context of this paper are texts that fulfill some sort of purpose.
	A community whose success is almost completely reliant on various genres circulating within it is the Honors LLC. The Honors LLC began in the fall semester of 2016 as an addition to Nugent Hall with the goal of creating a diverse motivated learning environment. Nugent Hall’s Honors LLC follows a fairly simple mission statement that outlines three main pillars: Inquiry, Civic Engagement, and Leadership. In its first year the Honors LLC has been successful in fulfilling its three pillars but has not been as active as originally perceived. The lack of activity within the Honors LLC can be accredited to the genres within the genre system. A genre system is a collection of genres that each contribute to achieving a goal within a specified system of human interaction (Bazerman, 2004). The purpose of analyzing genre systems of an activity system is that they provide valuable insights into the patterns of social interactions, and indicate certain goals and the way they have changed over time. In this paper, the genre system being analyzed involves the communicative genres within the LLC, that allow for social interactions and events to occur. The importance of this analytical review of the Honors LLC is to distinguish the various genres and genre systems used within the activity system to endorse social interaction, and how these genres can be better implemented in the future.
	This study will dissect the role that various written genres play in the system of communication within the Honors LLC, and its potential to grow. To accomplish this goal I will analyze various examples of textual communication such as: emails, bulletins, posters, mission statements, and facebook group. In a community such as the Honors LLC residents are seeking community involvement, leadership, inquiry, and scholarship; to accomplish these goals a strong system of communication is required. The Honors LLC is lacking in its maiden year, requiring more support for establishing an effective means of communication from both its staff and residents. Primarily, residents must be given some form of executive position to create a fluid line of communication between them and the Honors LLC program director.
	The current state of the Honors LLC incorporates many texts as methods of connecting the program director to the residents, and providing information about private events. To discover if the current genres effectively relay information I interviewed multiple residents of the Honors LLC on their perspective.
	I interviewed two female residents Jessica and Brianna that will not be returning to the Honors LLC the following semester. Pseudonyms are being implemented for all of the residents who were interviewed. These two were asked how effective the methods of communication that the program director used were. Jessica detailed that the mass emails seemed to be very effective but personally she often disregards them for significant periods of time until she dedicates a day to going through her email. The two roommates were also asked how many Honors LLC events they took part in throughout their first semester, and if communication ever caused an issue. The two residents were also asked how they saw the importance of genres such as: announcement posters, PD emails, and mission statement. They were also asked about their opinions on what a better means of communication would be if the current one was not sufficient.
	An interview was also conducted with a male resident that will be returning to the Honors LLC the following semester. This member was asked how effective the methods of communication that the program director used to communicate with members of the LLC. He was also asked about how many Honors LLC events he took part in during his first semester. Following, Michael was asked if the means of communication caused any problems with him attending more events. Michael was asked to describe the importance of textual genres such as: announcement posters, PD emails, and mission statement. He was then asked what a better means or system of communication would be if the current one was insufficient.
	I also interviewed a male resident, James, who will not be returning to Honors LLC the following semester. This resident was asked about the means of communication that the program director uses to interact with members of the Honors LLC. He was also asked how many Honors LLC specific events he attended, and if he felt communication created a barrier for attending more of them. The resident was also asked for his opinions about the text genres used to facilitate communication such as: announcement posters, PD emails, and mission statement. He was then asked a follow-up question regarding ideas about different methods of communicate assuming the current standards were not effective.
	I also interviewed Jacob a male resident that would be returning to University Housing not the Honors LLC the following year as an RA. He was asked about the main resources the program director uses as a means of communication. The resident was asked how many Honors LLC events he attended over the course of his first semester at UIUC, and if he felt that the current genres of communication limited his ability to attend these events. Joe was also asked if there were any text genres that he felt dictated communication above other such as: announcement posters, PD emails, and mission statement. He was then asked what other resources he would personally want implemented to support the communication between the Honors LLC program director and residents.
	By the use of the activity analysis, I found that there exist a niche that needs to be filled within the activity system that is the Honors LLC. While the residents of the Honors LLC would like a better means of communication it seems that there is no place for them to intervene. Inversely, the LLC program director understands that there exists a fault in the current communication system and is currently in the process of creating a resolution.
	The Honors LLC began its first year in the fall semester in the fall semester of 2016, encompassing the 3rd and 4th  floors of the previous Nugent Hall. The tools used within the Honors LLC are the mass emails, bulletins, posters, facebook groups, and social events. The mass emails attempt to engage the members of the LLC and keep them connected to the organization. The emails consist of information regarding upcoming events and opportunities, as well as general updates about the current state of the community. The motive of the Honors LLC is to facilitate a safe learning environment while at the same time promoting academic inquiry, leadership, scholarship, integrity, honesty, and civic engagement. These driving forces are reaffirmed within the mission statement of the Honors LLC. The rules are explicitly defined as the compilation of the Campus Honors Standards, University Housing policy, roommate contract, and simply respect.

The community in the Honors LLC consist of the male and female residents, and the faculty that provide the structure behind the organization. The division of labor is the area of the activity system that causes an issue across the entire activity system by directly impacting the effectiveness of the current, as well as future, tools.
The current division of labor within the LLC as it stands is solely the program director not to in anyway take away from his ability, but it is insufficient. The two primary textual genres currently used for residents to receive updates, information, and most importantly for coordination fails to accomplish this goal. Residents can’t be relayed messages effectively because there always seems to be some sort of miscommunication, and they can’t get in touch with the program director through email because he always seems to be busy (Jessica). The communication system working inside of the Honors LLC works similar to the “one and done policy,” in the sense that if the message didn’t get across the first time good luck ever retrieving the information that it held. There clearly exist a missing piece in the collaborative puzzle that is the LLC. This missing segment can best be summed up to an open means of communication allowing for fluid, effective, and efficient two way dialogue. In the name of research we must delve deeper into the division of labor to find why the current system is not working.
From a micro perspective the communication system itself can be analyzed as an activity system. In this system true deficiency can be seen in the means of communication, and much more deficiency can be spotted within the limited communicative ability that exist in the system. The genres included in this system are the LLC wide emails and Facebook group. The only division of labor that exist within this activity system is the program director; who is the only person in a position to relay and communicate with residents. While engaging with multiple members of the Honors LLC it became apparent that none of the residents could clearly identify the genre that was most crucial to the Honors LLC, in fact most individuals stated “I guess it would be the PD’s emails” (Brianna, Jacob, & Michael). This common uncertainty amongst the residents should not exist especially in such a small system where so few methods and genres are used for communication. It becomes excruciatingly apparent that the PD is creating a stoppage of communication where both residents of the Honors LLC can communicate with their director and the director can effectively get messages across to them. I was especially interested in receiving thoughts from returning students on what they would like to see as a solution, many of them stated that some sort of “middle-man” between the residents and faculty, similar to an RA but for Honors LLC purposes. After interviewing multiple residents from the LLC all involved with it in different ways, I have compiled and summarized what they would like to see out of the Honors LLC. They all agreed that there has to be another point of contact between the residents and the PD; someone that the residents can get in touch with and contact easily. Thus, the most fluid way to optimize the importance and effectiveness of genres, there must be another genre system producing the texts (or points of contact) in the LLC. Revising the current activity system with the request, I have developed a new activity triangle (see Figure 3) which in the future can create a more active, efficient, and involved living environment.
The recently introduced Honors LLC has had success as far as the goals of its mission statement are concerned but the LLC was meant to accomplish much more than that. The Honors LLC was attempting to create an actively involved and inclusive community, due to its lack of communicative genres it fails to achieve those goals. Multiple genres are the growing point for community based organizations such as this one, they provide the assistance in required areas to allow for expansion. In order for the Honors LLC to reach its full potential it must develop a revised set of genres to enable efficient communication, which will in turn formulate an active and involved community.
