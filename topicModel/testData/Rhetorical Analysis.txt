A Rhetorical Analysis of Casey Neistat’s: Opportunity and Obligation TED Talk
During November of 2014, Casey Neistat delivered a compelling closing presentation for The Wonder of Design themed TEDx (an independently organized TED) event. Casey Neistat is an independent filmmaker, concurrent high profile YouTube vlogger, and a humanitarian. The Wonder of Design TED event was held at Francis Parker High School with an audience made up significantly of high school age students and a few adults. Casey being a true “rags to riches” success story was not interested so much in the theme of the event, but preferred to present on a different topic: opportunity. This new topic had its genesis in a notion that Neistat clearly stated “I want to talk about something I wish I knew as a kid around high school age.” This would drive the remainder of the presentation to be catered towards students in their teenage years. Neistat’s presentation motivated the student audience, regardless of current background, to believe that there is unseen opportunity all around them.
In attendance were students that went out of their way to apply for the opportunity to attend the TedX presentation. The audience, while consisting primarily of students, was still diverse in multiple areas such as socioeconomic background, perspective, and social understanding. Some students were coming from suffering backgrounds, and others came from the higher end of the spectrum. It is important to understand the diversity amongst the students because it provides a stage for the rhetoric that Neistat uses to weave his narrative. Students respond to presentation stimuli in a different way than adults in the sense that they may not be as interested in listening to an individual speak for hours. Thus, the rhetorical language that Neistat uses must connect, relate, and be relevant to the student audience. 
The exigence of Neistat’s presentation, one’s obligation to embracing opportunity, came from his own personal narrative and the struggle he faced at a similar age as the audience that was in attendance at this event. In Neistat’s experience, after having to drop out of high school to raise his newly born son and picking up whatever work he could, it is crucial for him to demonstrate that success and opportunity can be found in almost any situation regardless of how low one feels. This discourse is personal to Neistat, being a humanitarian, and is attempting to make an impact by inciting a new positive mentality amongst the students. Casey, as the rhetor, embraced rhetorical language to attempt to invigorate and motivate the audience’s perspective on life to be more open to opportunity. It is his goal to spark a fire within the individuals to embrace opportunity in all forms, and not just in its most visible and recognizable forms. 
The genre of the presentation was one of empowerment; it resembled a similar style to a motivational speech. This genre space was created by the use of various communicative genres such as Neistat’s speech and a short film he displayed as a closing to his presentation. Using these two tools, he was able to develop a presentation environment geared toward motivating students to take risk and embrace opportunity. Casey’s speech then transforms into a more supportive tone where he assures the members of the audience that they are in a position to take advantage of the previous advice. Overall, throughout the presentation, Neistat creates a genre that is embracing, motivating, empowering, and supporting, while allowing the concepts he is demonstrating to be easily understood. 
Neistat, from the beginning of his presentation, draws the crowd’s attention by playing an unrelated film as a way to draw the young audience in. Following, Casey does something a bit absurd to most adults. In retrospect, he claims, “the first big opportunity and pivot point, wow I’m playing with fire saying this to high school students, was getting my highschool girlfriend pregnant.” This statement sets a stage for the thesis of Neistat’s presentation: an individual can find opportunity regardless of how difficult the situation at hand is. By the rhetor, Casey, making such a questionable acquisition directly at the beginning of his talk, he is drawing the audience’s attention towards him. This drawing in of the audience creates an idea amongst the audience that allows the students to connect to Neistat’s future points. This was an intelligent and necessary move. Although risky, the students will now accept what Neistat has to say. What Neistat has done is created an engaged audience; one that will be active in discussion and following the emotions that are provided by the rhetor. 
Drawing the audience in further, Neistat continues to describe the situation his life was in while in high school. The rhetor develops the base for his presentation further by starting it with a recap of his life during his high school years. Casey does this by stating, “I was never really good at school … never any good at sports … so when I found out I was going to be a dad at the ripe age of 16, I saw this tremendous opportunity.” The statement by Neistat further sets the stage of “when I was your age” by truly creating a connection to the audience through honesty and providing the reality of his high school situation. The students in the audience appreciated this honesty and reality because, in many cases, when adults speak to the students, they can’t always relate. Neistat does a lot of preparation during the first few minutes of his presentation, and, by doing so, he creates a relative speaking space where he makes the audience assured of their mishaps and shortcomings. 
Reaffirming his points, Neistat employs multiple examples from his own personal struggles and risks. As the Rhetor, Neistat expertly involves many examples to make his presentation relatable and “real” for the audience. Through the story, Neistat is weaving, he is able to provide examples rich with pathos and comedy. The power of the examples Neistat imports into his presentation come when you see the simplicity of some of the things many of us wouldn’t see as opportunity, juxtaposed with the immense ones that many of us couldn’t ever imagine taking. In Neistat’s words, “I heard about this really famous artist who made all these cool sculptures out of police barricades that was offering a $10 dollar bounty per barricade. So that night, 20 year old Casey borrowed a hand truck and went around New York disassembling barricades.” For some, this might be a very big opportunity, but the truth is the action was extreme not the minutiae opportunity. At this point Casey begins to describe his notion of opportunity and obligation; the idea that there are opportunities in every situation, and it is our obligation to find and take advantage of them. The action of bringing all his points back to examples relates his speech to reality, assuring the audience that he had been in a vast amount of situations and what he is sharing is knowledge acquired in the process. The audience is able to relate to this action of exemplifying the idea by drawing them in further into the narrative the rhetor is delivering about opportunity and obligation.
The rhetor employs a touch of comedic relief to withdrawal from the emotional aspects he exerts in his attempts to engage the audience through the use of personal examples. This comedic relief comes in various forms throughout the presentation and at unpredictable, but necessary, times. Such an application of comedic relief can be seen in Neistat’s statement, following a brief description of how an employer of his was stressed about having to hire a new project manager, “let me help you with the interviews. I don’t know what possessed me. I am not qualified to help him with the interviews, it just seemed like an appropriate thing to say at the moment” illicites the audience to recover from the negative emotional implications made by previous statements. The comedy employed is coupled with a casual friendly tone; one that does not demean the acts of the current high school generation. In some talks provided by successful individuals to high school age students, there sometimes exists a demeaning tone that creates a disconnect with younger audiences. Casey dispels this by using neutral language as demonstrated by his statement, “I remember these interviews. I am like the lowest man on the totem pole. My responsibilities included cleaning out the litter box, wiping the toilet seat, and taking out the trash, but I really saw opportunity in that kitty litter box.” Neistat doesn’t use the motivational tone of language that one would expect from a talk based around the topic of Opportunity and Obligation. Using and employing both of these types of languages, Neistat is able to incite laughter and attention amongst the students that make up the entirety of the audience. 
Wrapping up his talk, Casey presents a final example with a perfect ethos; a film that he had made two years prior that he felt effectively summarized our obligation to take advantage of our opportunities and the risk associated with doing so. In Neistat’s words, describing the inception of the film “I got an offer from a corporation … make a movie about your dreams and I said ‘no’ … but I went to bed that night and I was just thinking I have a great opportunity to make a movie and I’m saying no because it sounds dumb... I started reflecting back and I started thinking where is the opportunity here.” Here we can see the universal human application of the lesson where, just like any other individual, he would struggle with a situation they didn’t see instant personal gain. By providing the thought process before creating this immense opportunity, he is once again showing his humanity, and the studential audience is once again able to relate to the message. 
The film Neistat provides as a conclusion to his talk was a relief mission for typhoon victims in the Philippines he created using the promotional funding he was given to create a promo for the movie The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. In this film, he convinces the 20th Century Fox movie studio to approve the use of the promotion budget to benefit the typhoon victims. He then takes flight to the Philippines, purchases the entire budget in relief supplies, rents a few buses, and loads them with supplies to drive 5 hours to the disaster area. Upon arrival, multiple individuals instantly begin the packaging of 2,000 relief care packages. This final move that Neistat makes is the culmination of all the ideas of opportunity. Our obligation is to take that opportunity, regardless of notable gains (or lack of), and accept the fact that some risk is necessary. It is the last key demonstration of Neistat’s ethos which connects to the crowd in an impactful and meaningful manner, as demonstrated by their energetic praise. 
	Neistat’s TED Talk provides insights into what he truly values as the critical points in creating his success and seeks to instill the same values that he, in hindsight, is able to see about his past into the students in the audience. Casey is able to create an empowering and relatable talk by expertly using many rhetorical strategies to manipulate the audience to create connections with the narrative he is formulating. By incorporating certain moves, Neistat is able to incite the response he wants from the audience. Through the use of similar actions, Neistat is able to keep a teenage audience entertained, engaged, and involved in the talk he is providing. Neistat, as a rhetor, is able to effectively engage a plethora of rhetorical strategies to provide a coherent and valuable talk to one of the hardest audiences to present to because of lack of focus or attention in most cases.
