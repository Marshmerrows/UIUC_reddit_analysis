Random Acts of Kindness

	In the article Random Acts of Kindness Define Who We Really Are, author Marc Joseph describes, with an overarching theme, the notion that at the end of our lives it is what we gave to others that truly defines who we are. Joseph goes on to speak about the relationship between impressionable child and parent that will ultimately modify the behavior that the child will demonstrate throughout its life. Parents must exemplify the exact behavior that they would want their child to. In the case that a parent demonstrates a behavior filled with good deeds, the child will grow up responding to the world by similar means. The child will then grow up mimicking the behavior and create a generational lineage of  children committing good deeds, consisting (hopefully) of Random Acts of Kindness. The article diverges from the focus on children being ingrained with good deeds as a meaningful way of life to a macro perspective of society mimicking behavior of role models in the media. Similarly to the child-parent relationship, individuals can be motivated to perform random acts of kindness if a respected role model (ie. sports star, movie star, musician) takes part in generous behavior. Finally, the article ends with a reaffirmation that it does not require a sports or movie star to perform some kind of random acts of kindness.

Day 1: Saturday 18th
A friend has been at a very low point for the last few weeks. In the hopes of making her feel better, I will organize all her close friends to write out hundreds of post-notes with messages, jokes, or positive comments. Then, I will take these notes and cover her side of the room with them while she is being distracted by her roommate. This random act of kindness sparked motivation for the rest of this project because it’ll start by benefiting an individual close to me. 
	Day 2: Sunday 19th
I called my parents to sincerely thank them for all the sacrifices they have made in the hopes that I would make them proud one day. This is a random act of kindness that I feel is truly necessary because my parents have done so much for me, but it always seems like I never have enough time for them. 
	Day 3: Monday 20th 
I will combat the overall effect of Monday to create a gloomy mood by smiling and saying good morning to as many individuals as possible before noon. This random act of kindness brings a little mutualistic joy to all the individuals involved. 
	Day 4: Tuesday 21st
I will help a student in my Calculus I class that is always in my discussion group who I’ve noticed is struggling. It’ll be the night before the exam so I will reach out to him in discussion and let him know that I can work with him later that afternoon. This act will provide me with the opportunity to truly test my ability and study, while helping a stranger understand material I understand.
Day 5: Wednesday 22nd
I will hold the door for every individual that I can without going too far out of my way, but I will do so with a hint of style. The style will come from a motion or a stance I will take while holding the door, and this will add a sense of humor to the situation. The goal of this day is to bring some liveliness on the halfway point of the week when the day seems just a bit too slow. 
Day 6: Thursday 23rd
On my way back from class I pass by a street with parking meters, and as I was passing, I saw one had run out. Thinking quickly, I added the three quarters I had to buy the individual a few more minutes. This act was truly a random act of kindness, and, in the spurt of the moment, I decided to help the individual out. 
Day 7: Friday 24th
Today, I set out to provide at least one compliment to each resident of my dorm floor regarding their outfit for the day. I chose this random act of kindness because it is simple, however, it could make an individual's entire day. The second reason I selected this act was that I believe in the little things making the big impacts. 
	The method I used to complete the task was a modified version of the assignment. I felt motivated one afternoon and decided that beginning then I would complete my truly random acts of kindness for the following six days. Thus, the method by which I recorded the random acts of kindness in section B were retrospective, and done in a journal format with my experience included above. However, each experience was very rewarding and entertaining seeing the various responses of the individuals receiving the acts. I also felt that this was the most genuine way of truly performing “random acts of kindness”, and, had I planned these out, I wouldn’t have been able to truly help people that randomly needed help. 
Committing to performing random acts of kindness for a week was, in my opinion, two	parts beneficial. The first benefit was being the recipient and the second was being myself. The individuals that I performed these random acts of kindness for, and have since seen again, have been very appreciative. As a result of their appreciation and gratitude, I felt better about myself, and as though I had truly made an impact on somebody’s day. I learned that people can be appreciative of the smallest of gestures. Something as small as a smile, compliment, or a good morning could easily make a portion of an individual's day. I also learned that more people should be challenged to partake in random acts of kindness and be informed that it does not have to be a be a large act. I have always understood that performing random acts of kindness is a good rewarding experience, but I always thought in the big picture and figured I didn’t have time for these acts. However, after being assigned to take part in acts of kindness, I have realized that the acts are not very costly. Regarding time, they can be as simple as standing at the door an extra second to let someone else in. I feel that this exercise has motivated me to take part in more acts of kindness, but I will stick to the small things for the time being. 
	If I had this assignment to do over again, I would have made a greater effort to make more of the individuals that received the random acts of kindness strangers. I felt that I restricted myself when performing the acts. I only truly left my comfort zone once with my act of holding the door open with complete style. The only other time that I truly felt that I was creating random acts of kindness was when I was walking home and put some change into a stranger’s parking meter, this assignment was definitely a different experience. Thus, going forward I am going to seek out more opportunities to produce random acts of kindness for complete strangers. Overall, I have enjoyed taking part in this experience, and will make a serious effort to continue creating instances of random acts of kindness.
