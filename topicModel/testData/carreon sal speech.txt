Good Evening.   Once I was told after my eighth grade graduation that life and all the opportunities presented in it from there on could be represented by being gifted a tree sapling. Strange?  I thought so too.  But then I began to think, if we are provided the gift of life and opportunities to better it, who are we squander them?  See, it is taking full advantage of the opportunities in life that is synonymous with taking care of the sapling.  If the sapling is not cared for correctly, and the opportunities are not seized, then the tree will wither away in time. So take advantage of all the great opportunities that are laid in front of us because of this great institution, De La Salle.
Friends… Brothers… we are nearing the end of our journey together, one that we have desperately awaited for many years.  Now that we gather, doesn’t it seem bitter-sweet?  Like it’s not supposed to end yet.  Where did the time go?  It seems like just yesterday Mr. Brogan was calling out kids who were wearing white socks with dress shoes, and you sat there a few feet across from the last victim desperately trying to hide the fact that you too, were wearing white socks.  It’s been a long and eventful four years since that day.  On that day, I knew almost no one at De, today I stand in front of you all proud to call you family.  The class of 2016 has been the best class to be a part of.  There will never be another class with as much school spirit and drive as us.  The big games will never be the same without us, an apology to the class of 2017, but you all can’t get involved like we did.  Whether it was Tony running the flag at a volleyball game or the entire senior class getting coordinated in a chant, our class was always showing their support. And how can anyone forget the sportsmanship learned on the field that we carried off the field and into the classroom?  This is the closing of one chapter of our lives but merely the beginning of the next. 
As we assemble today to celebrate our great achievement, I feel that there are a few faculty members who also should be celebrated, for without them this commencement would never be possible.  I want to thank Mr. Jackowiak for being much more than just a math teacher, but also a mentor.  I would like to send a sincere thank you to Mr. Dirschl for being there for every one of his students since the first day, teaching us history, life skills, and tips to help us out down the road.  Coach Maldonado, you deserve more thanks than anyone!  You pushed me to be my best, taught me motivation and drive, things I did not understand before.  The mentoring you gave me both inside the classroom and inside the ring meant more to me than you will ever understand.  Thank you.  Does anyone remember those deals that Mr. Garcia was famous for?  Or how about what Mitochondria is responsible for?  How about some of Mr. Wegesin’s goofy jokes?  And no one will ever forget Mr. Dirschl’s use of innovative next generation video game technology in class.  Without a doubt, we will carry many memories from De La Salle with us for the rest of our lives.
I’d like to give one very special thanks to someone in the audience.  That man right over there, my father, has struggled to raise me since the day I was born.  He has led me and provided me with incalculable amounts of wisdom without ever saying a word.  He taught me to be humble even in the situations where it was easiest to become prideful, and he showed me how to have a sense of humor during life’s bad times. Esta es para mi padre ya más de cuarenta, y no se le notan. Sigue siendo un terco, el viene de abajo, trabajo de niño, le ayudo a mi abuelo, su vida es mi familia y mí. Te agradezco tanto tu sacrificio apa y cómo crees que está haciendo mi arbolito?  
I know that every one of my peers would like nothing more than to come up and give thanks to their families but since they cannot, I would like to, on behalf of my brothers, say Thank You for always being there.  And now I leave you with this -- We are destined to be the next great generation, and if we are to fulfill this, we must apply every lesson we learned over our time.  Get up and take action, this is our world now. Best of luck to all my fellow Meteors!  I hope to hear good things about you all in the future.  Thank You.
